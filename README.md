# LeetCodeSolutions
This repository is meant to store my solutions to LeetCode problems. The language used will be Python, but other languages may be added in the future.


## Folder Structure
At the outermost level there are 3 folders - one for each category/difficulty. A number has been prepended the folder name in order to sort it in a specific way (`Easy -> Medium -> Hard`). Inside each category there is a folder for each problem with the naming format `<problem ID> - <problem name>`.

For instance, the first problem is the `Two Sum` problem. Since it is the first problem, it also has the ID 1. The folder for the solution of this problem is therefore called `(1) -Two Sum`. Within each folder containing a problem there is a folder for each language that the problem has been solved in.

## Contributions
Feel free to contribute to this repository if you can solve problems that haven't been solved already, can solve a problem in a language that currently has no solution for said problem or you have an optimized version of a solution. In the case of an optimized solution, it will be **added alongside (rather than replace) the old solution**.
